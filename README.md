# tipApp
This app will calculate the total outstanding per patron on a bill &amp; split it across with the tip percent

# Installation
Once cloned, the app should be accessible via Xcode & running it

# Background
This app is an original stub clone of The App Brewery - Tipsy app (better name but Copyright) thus the AutoLayout and initial view controller has a
different author.

The challenge was to use the previously learnt topics to then create a segue app that also uses MVC although that was not the main objective rather:
- Classes & inheritance (by using UIViews as an example)
- Segues & how to create objects via inheritance
- Advanced optionals
- I added a struct to remove the non-view controls
